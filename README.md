# Simplepin

A simple iOS app for your [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/) bookmarks. Simplepin makes reading and managing your Pinboard bookmarks easy. With just the most basic features done right, it's a good companion for any Pinboard user. Please note that Simplepin does not have offline support.

> [!Note]
> Simplepin will soon be sunsetting. Simplepin was the first iOS app I've ever built. I was thrilled to see how many users found it useful and all the positive feedback it got. It has been years since the app received its last update and I think now is the time to pull the plug. I sincerely thank all users for their support and apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. For those interested, you can still find the source code from this repo. ðŸ’™
